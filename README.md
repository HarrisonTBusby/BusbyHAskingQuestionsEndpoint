# BusbyHAskingQuestionsEndpoint

This program asks what your name is and then asks a userInputted question in the URL of postman and then spits out the response in the terminal.

//Peer reviewed by: Carlos Felipe: This program is clean. The endpoint routes and controller are both formatted correctly. My input was taken in and converted to a output string. One thing I thought was redundant was the use of AskingQuestions in the route. You could simply have done : localhost/askingquestion(the controller) /{name}/{place}. But other than that everything works well. Good job!
